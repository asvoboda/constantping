Constant Ping
=============

Dumb C# Application written when I was bored to hit some server (in this case www.google.com) to test out a constant ping connection. Updates a system tray icon to be green/orange/red and provides a form for the exact value. 

Project can be run, and the exe will be found under bin/debug (or bin/release if release settings are configured) and can be run.
